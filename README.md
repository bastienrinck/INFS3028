## Software Quality Handbook assignment

The aim of this project is to produce a handbook to inform future employees about the different methodologies and good development practices used in the company.
In order to carry out this project, we first need to create the different branches that will be necessary for this project, namely: 
-    Master
-    Develop
-    Hotfix

Thereafter, each topic in this handbook will have its own branch which follows the following scheme: feature/[topic name].
The three topics will be dealt with in parallel, each under the responsibility of one of the collaborators of this project:
- Task estimation: Bastien Rinck
- Coding standards: Thibaut Cornolti
- Code review: Nicolas Verdi√©
Each member can freely contribute to all topics. When a topic is finished, it will be merged with the develop branch, and when all the topics have been validated, the develop branch will be merged with master.
If a change is to be made to one of the topics in the develop branch, it will be done through the hotfix branch.
